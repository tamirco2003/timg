# timg
.timg - An unnecessary file type.
## What is this?
Just a stupid project I decided to make.
## How to use
To convert an image to a timg file, just drag it onto the "imgToTimg.py" file.
To convert an timg file to png, just drag it onto the "timgToPng.py" file.
The outputs will be called "out.timg" and "out.jpg".

"timgImageViewer.py" works the same way right now.
## What comes next?
I'm making a more fleshed out version of TIV (Timg Image Viewer).
## More importantly, why?
Good Question.
