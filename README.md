# timg
.timg - An unnecessary file type.
## What is this?
Just a stupid project I decided to make.
## How to use
To convert an image to a timg file, just drag it onto the "imgToTimg.py" file.
To convert an timg file to jpg, just drag it onto the "imgToTimg.py" file.
The outputs will be called "out.timg" and "out.jpg".
## What comes next?
Well I'm currently working on a timg image viewer, or "tiv". So be ready for that.
## More importantly, why?
Good Question.
